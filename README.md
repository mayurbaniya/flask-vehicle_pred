👁️‍🗨️ Project Overview:

▫️Objective: To predict vehicle prices based on various input parameters like vehicle age, brand, model, and kilometers driven.

▫️Backend: The Flask backend hosts the machine learning model and handles API requests from the Flutter frontend. It processes the input data, runs predictions using the RandomForestRegressor model, and returns the results.

▫️Frontend: The Flutter application serves as the user interface where users can input vehicle details and receive price predictions. The design, built with VelocityX, is kept minimalistic to emphasize the core functionality of the ML model.


♦️ This project showcases the integration of machine learning with mobile application development, providing an efficient solution for vehicle price estimation.
